# Models directory
# Place your trained ML models here after training in Google Colab:

## Pattern Agent Model
**Filename:** `pattern_agent_tiny.pkl` (or `pattern_model.pkl`)
- Single Pipeline file containing TF-IDF vectorizer + Logistic Regression classifier
- Trained using: sklearn Pipeline
- The agent will look for either filename

## Behavior Agent Model
**Filename:** `behavior_iforest.pkl`
- sklearn IsolationForest model for anomaly detection
- Features: ["amount", "hour", "frequency", "day_of_week", "delta_hours"]
- No scaler needed - IsolationForest handles normalization internally

**Note:** 
- Model must be saved using `joblib.dump()` in Colab
- If model not found, falls back to rule-based analysis
- IsolationForest detects anomalies by identifying outliers in feature space

## Installation:
After placing models, restart the Flask backend server.
