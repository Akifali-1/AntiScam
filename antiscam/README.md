# FIGMENT - Anti-Scam UPI Transaction Protector

A multi-agent AI system that analyzes UPI transactions in real-time to detect potential scams before users complete payments. Built for hackathon demonstration with explainable AI agents.

## 🎯 Project Overview

FIGMENT uses **4 specialized AI agents** to analyze each transaction from different perspectives:
- **Pattern Agent** 🕵️ - Detects scam text patterns using ML
- **Network Agent** 🕸️ - Checks receiver ID against community scam reports
- **Behavior Agent** 🔍 - Identifies unusual user behavior patterns using anomaly detection
- **Biometric Agent** 🎭 - Monitors typing patterns for signs of pressure

Each agent provides a **risk score with detailed explanations**, and the system combines these scores to give users a clear, actionable warning before completing potentially fraudulent transactions.

## ✨ Key Capabilities

- **Dynamic Threat Clustering** — ML embeddings (TF-IDF/sentence similarity) group reported receivers into scam clusters automatically. New reports trigger cluster re-evaluation nightly.
- **Intelligent Alert System** — Real-time WebSocket alerts fire when a receiver the user is transacting with is found in a trending threat list or a known scam cluster.
- **Feedback Loop** — After every transaction the user can confirm if it was a scam. Once 10 new confirmations are collected, the Pattern and Behavior models are retrained automatically.
- **Gemini AI Integration** — Generates 2-3 sentence, plain-language explanations of *why* a transaction was flagged, including threat intelligence context (cluster membership, trending reports).
- **Real-time Dashboard** — Live analytics pulled from MongoDB, auto-refreshing every 5 minutes.
- **Threat Intelligence Hub** — View top active scam clusters and trending threats in one place.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16+)
- **Python** (3.8+)
- **MongoDB Atlas account** (or local MongoDB)

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
cd Backend

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create .env file
# Add your MongoDB connection string and Gemini API key:
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/?appName=Cluster0
DB_NAME=AntiScam
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

**Place ML Models:**
- Download trained models from Colab
- Place `pattern_agent_tiny.pkl` and `behavior_iforest.pkl` in `Backend/models/`

**Seed Sample Scam Data (Optional):**
You can manually add scam reports through the `/api/report` endpoint or by directly inserting into MongoDB `scam_reports` collection.

**Start Backend:**
```bash
python app.py
```
Backend runs on `http://localhost:5000`

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd Frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```
Frontend runs on `http://localhost:3000`

## 🤖 AI Agents Explained

### 1. Pattern Agent 🕵️
**Purpose:** Detects known scam text patterns in transaction messages

**How it works:**
- Uses TF-IDF vectorization + Logistic Regression
- Trained on scam text datasets
- Analyzes: transaction reason/message + receiver UPI ID
- Returns: Risk score (0-100%) with detected patterns

**Model:** `pattern_agent_tiny.pkl` (sklearn Pipeline)

---

### 2. Network Agent 🕸️
**Purpose:** Checks if receiver ID has been reported as a scammer

**How it works:**
- Queries MongoDB `scam_reports` collection
- Uses crowd-sourced intelligence from user reports
- Risk calculation based on report count:
  - 10+ reports → 95% risk
  - 5-9 reports → 80% risk
  - 2-4 reports → 60% risk
  - 1 report → 40% risk
  - 0 reports → 10% risk

**No ML Model Required** - Pure database queries

---

### 3. Behavior Agent 🔍
**Purpose:** Detects anomalies in user's transaction behavior

**How it works:**
- Uses IsolationForest anomaly detection
- Analyzes 5 features:
  - `amount` - Transaction amount
  - `hour` - Hour of day (0-23)
  - `frequency` - Transaction frequency
  - `day_of_week` - Day of week (0-6)
  - `delta_hours` - Hours since last transaction
- Learns user's normal patterns
- Flags unusual transactions

**Model:** `behavior_iforest.pkl` (sklearn IsolationForest)

---

### 4. Biometric Agent 🎭
**Purpose:** Monitors typing patterns for signs of pressure/rushing

**How it works:**
- Analyzes typing speed (WPM)
- Tracks hesitation/correction count
- Detects rapid input (scammer pressure)
- Detects excessive hesitation (uncertainty)

**No ML Model Required** - Rule-based analysis

---

## 🧠 Gemini AI Integration

**Purpose:** Generates 2-3 human-readable summaries explaining why a transaction was flagged as a scam

**How it works:**
- Receives transaction details and individual agent scores
- **Includes threat intelligence data** (trending threats, cluster matches, historical reports)
- Creates contextual prompts for Gemini with full threat context
- Returns simple, actionable explanations that mention threat intelligence when available
- Falls back gracefully if API key is not configured

**Threat Intelligence Context:**
- If receiver is in trending threats → Explains report count and threat score
- If receiver is in a known cluster → Mentions cluster name and pattern
- If message matches a scam pattern → Describes pattern similarity and history

---

## 📊 Real-time Dashboard

**Features:**
- Real analytics data from MongoDB
- Auto-refresh every 5 minutes
- Transaction history tracking
- Scam prevention metrics
- Risk distribution visualization
- **Threat Intelligence Hub** - Shows top 5 scam clusters and trending threats
